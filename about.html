    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Kim! I’m the owner of Passionate Pet Pros, LLC. I grew up in New Jersey and now call Port Charlotte, FL home.</p>
    <p>Throughout the years, I’ve had several pets apart of my family. Before moving to Florida, I helped out with a friend’s pet sitting and dog walking business in NJ. That’s when I realized how much I truly loved it. That experience pushed me to follow my passion and start my own business. Additionally, prior to helping man’s best friend, I have years of experience as a human companion.</p>
    <p>When I’m looking after your pets, they’ll be treated just like my own. Along with being fully licensed and bonded, I am comfortable administering medicine and shots so your pets get everything they need. My goal is to give you peace of mind knowing they’re happy, safe, and loved while you’re away.</p>
